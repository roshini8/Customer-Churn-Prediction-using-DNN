# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-DNN

Aimed to predict customer churn, a crucial challenge for businesses, using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). 
The primary focus is on comparing the impact of different numbers of neurons in the network layers on prediction performance.
Used the Customer Churn Modeling Dataset from UCI Repository and the model is trained over 1000 epoche and compares the performance of multilayer network and single layer and uses deep neural network.

•	Developed and implemented a sophisticated Customer Churn Prediction system utilizing state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in Python.
•	Designed and trained a deep neural network model to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data.
•	Conducted rigorous feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the raw data, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy.
•	Generated actionable insights and reports based on the model's predictions to aid in customer retention strategies and business decision-making.
